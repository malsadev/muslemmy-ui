## What is it Lemmy?

The short version is, that Lemmy is similar to Reddit. The main difference is that Lemmy is Open-Source and Federated. This means that there is no single huge "Lemmy Server" but many smaller "instances" of Lemmy hosted by different people. These instances can communicate with each other, so you can follow people on other instances and see their posts and comments.

## Why muslemmy-ui?

No particular reason. I like Lemmy and the idea of a federated internet universe so I decided to build a UI for it. Even though there are many UIs out there for Lemmy, there doesn't seem to be one built with the technologies I chose.

## Built with
* Vue.js
* Bootstrap
* lemmy-js-client

> [!warning]
> This project is still in early development phase. It is currently not configured to work on a public instance.
